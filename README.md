# IDS_road_accidents
This is the repository for Introduction to Data Science course project 2023, for group F5. The project concerns analysis of road accident data in the UK between 1979 and 2022.
We aim to visualise aspects of the data, for example how the number of total and deadly accidents have changed during the 43 years that the data has been collected for. We will also explore how other features relate to the road accidents, e.g., weather/road surface conditions, age/sex of driver, type of vehicle, light conditions, speed limit, etc. This exploration will help us select features that seem to have an effect on accidents (and their severity?). After this, we will use machine learning to classify the severity of an accident.
